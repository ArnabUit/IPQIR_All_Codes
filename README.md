# IPQIR_All_Codes

This has 3 different types of codes. **1. Quantum Simulation using Qiskit Aer Simulator** 
                                     **2. Classical simulation using Python in classical computer** 
                                     **3. Application of the proposed encoding in medical image classification**



For **Quantum Simulation using Qiskit Aer Simulator:** the uploaded file namely *IPQIR_Simulation_in_Qiskit* contains runtime of the code along with implementation of the proposed encoding for a sample test image.

For **Classical simulation using Python in classical computer**, the uploaded files are *Equal_Superposition_using_Hadamard_Gate_original.ipynb* and *Equal_Superposition_rgb.ipynb* are python implementation of the proposed encoding in classical computer. It generates classical simulation of the proposed encoding. The runtime along with the description is provided as description of the code.

Finally **Application of the proposed encoding in medical image classification**, the corresponding uploaded files are *classical-classical-model.ipnyb* and *quantum-classical-model.ipnyb* respectively. The classical-classical-model uses classical data with classical model and quantum-classical-model uses classical simulation of the quantum encoded data with classical model. The details of the datasets and link of are given in the file *Medical Image Dataset*, which are publicly available for tesing the algorithm.
